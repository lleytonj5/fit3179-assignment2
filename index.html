        Electricity usage around the world

    <!-- <div id="bar_chart">

    <p id="intro">In this visualisation we explore electricity usage around the world, breaking it down by country,
        and looking at who imports and exports the most electricity. We'll also look at energy production around the world.</p>
    <table style="width:100%;">

            <td class="carrycell" id="electricity_map">

                <strong>Who's using the most electricity overall?</strong>
                
                <p>
                    China takes the lead for the country using the greatest amount of electricity, consuming an incredible
                    4.6 million gigawatt-hours of electricity in a single year.
                </p>
                    The United States of America follows in 2nd place,
                    consuming 3.7 million gigawatt-hours per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it hasn't always been this way: drag the slider back in time, and you'll see
                    that while America's electricity usage has consistently been quite high for many years, China only rocketed to the top
                    in more recent years.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    The next closest country is Russia, only using about a quarter as much, with 756,000 gigawatt-hours consumed
                    in one year.

                <strong>Who are the biggest exporters of electricity?</strong>
                
                <p>
                    Not a lot of countries export electricity, but the two biggest exporters are France and Germany,
                    who respectively exported a massive 75 and 74 <em>terawatt-hours</em> of electricity in 2014!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not far behind is Canada, which exported 58 terawatt-hours of electricity in the same year.

                <p>
                    America comes out on top as the biggest electricity importer, importing 66 terawatt-hours
                    of electricity from other countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind them are Italy at 46 terawatt-hours (TWh), Germany at 40 TWh, and Brazil at 33 TWh.

                <strong>Which countries are leading the way in renewable electricity generation?</strong>
                <p>
                    In France, Sweden and Norway, over 90% of their electricity production comes from renewable sources.
                    Canada also manages 78% renewable energy generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia and the United States still have a way to go, with 13% and 30% of their electricity generation
                    coming from renewable sources, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several countries in Africa also have quite high renewable generation percentages,
                    but the total amount of electricity they produce is relatively small.
