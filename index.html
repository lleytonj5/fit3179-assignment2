        Electricity usage around the world

    <p id="intro">In this visualisation we explore electricity usage around the world, including energy usage by
        country, and by industry. We'll also look at energy production around the world.</p>

                <strong>Who's using the most electricity overall?</strong>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    China takes the lead for the country using the greatest amount of electricity, consuming an incredible
                    4.6 million gigawatt-hours of electricity in a single year.
                </p>
                    The United States of America follows in 2nd place,
                    consuming 3.7 million gigawatt-hours per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it hasn't always been this way: drag the slider back in time, and you'll see
                    that while America's electricity usage has consistently been quite high for many years, China only rocketed to the top
                    in more recent years.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    The next closest country is Russia, only using about a quarter as much, with 756,000 gigawatt-hours consumed
                    in one year.

                <p>
                    Not a lot of countries export electricity, but the two biggest exporters are France and Germany,
                    who respectively exported a massive 75 and 74 <em>terawatt-hours</em> of electricity in 2014!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not far behind is Canada, which exported 58 terawatt-hours of electricity in the same year.

                    America comes out on top as the biggest electricity importer, importing 66 terawatt-hours

                <p>
                    Behind them is Italy at 46 terawatt-hours, Germany at 40 TWh, and Brazil at 33 TWh.
